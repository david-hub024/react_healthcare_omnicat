    <h1>About OmniCAT</h1>
    <h2>At Home Ai Guided Biometrics Optimization</h2>
    <hr />
    <h3>Overview</h3>

    <p>OmniCAT is a library of clinical assessment tools and resources intended to empower
      patients to record, monitor and optimize personal health metrics with a high degree of
      proficiency, with or without the support of a qualified medical practitioner.
    </p>

    <p>Additionally, it allows providers to collate, analyse and optimize patients health
      metrics with a high degree of proficiency for support in diagnosis, patient management
      and treatment protocol implementation and supports access to distributed data systems
      and open secure multimedia communications with colleagues.
    </p>

    <p>Furthermore, the OmniCAT platform will provide greater accuracy in interpretation and
      diagnosis and increased success of treatment and management protocols, reduced costs of
      health care, improved patient engagement, awareness and outcomes for preventative measures
      as well as providing more substantial transparency.
    </p>

    <h3>Vision and Goal</h3>

    <p>Our vision is to contribute meaningfully to the proliferation of knowledge and
      education in preparation for the advent of emerging medical and healthcare technologies,
      treatments and therapies.
    </p>

    <p>Our goal is to influence a fundamental shift in the perception of medical data
      interpretation from the present paradigm to one which focuses on achieving optimal
      targets rather than normal or acceptable.
    </p>

    <h3>The Problem</h3>

    <p>National healthcare systems are broken - Reduce costs, improve diagnostic accuracy,
      increase patient engagement and awareness, enhance relevancy of medical data. Ensure
      sustainability.
    </p>

    <p>Every Dr is an island - Connect healthcare providers to each other; connect the
      patients to the health care providers. Decentralise the data.
    </p>

    <h3>Objectives</h3>

    <p>For the Patient - Record, monitor and optimise personal health metrics with a high
      degree of proficiency, with or without the support of a qualified medical practitioner.
    </p>

    <p>For the Provider - Collate, analyse and optimise patients health metrics with a high
      degree of proficiency for support in diagnosis, patient management and treatment protocol
      implementation. Access to distributed data systems and open secure multimedia
      communications with colleagues.
    </p>

    <p>For Organisations and Governments - Allow for greater accuracy in diagnosis and
      increased success of treatment and management protocols. Reduced costs of healthcare.
      Improved patient engagement and awareness and outcomes for preventative measures.
      More substantial transparency.
    </p>

    <h3>Scope</h3>

    <p>Physical Fitness; Biochemistry; Brain Health; Wellness; Aesthetics; Hormonal Health;
      Risk and Prevention
    </p>

    <h3>Usability Objectives</h3>

    <p>Enter medical data and read interpretation as relevant to the parameters provided
      by the Optimal Health Dataset.
    </p>

    <h3>Powered by Ethereum</h3>

    <p>OmniCAT uses smart contracts and the Ethereum blockchain to execute the logic
      of various clinical tools and assessments. This ensures transperency of our methods
      and enhances the proliferation of our open source materials and allows us to leverage
      the advantages of the ethereum virtual machine and its underlying distributed ledger
      technology.
